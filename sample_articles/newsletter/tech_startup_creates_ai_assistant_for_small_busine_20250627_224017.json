So it's not just me: there are many people who haven`t even gotten started yet (see section above). It is completely possible for beginners of all levels to learn programming by watching some tutorials online using an older version called Ruby on Rails which has had more than half a decade of success with its easy to use interface and extensive documentation like docs.rubyonrailsforge .
