It is being distributed on Reddit via r/science and has over 200 upvotes at time this writing. The story also appears online as an event report by Science Daily UK's website . This blog entry does not contain any editorial claims or conclusions about whether such technology exists but rather focuses solely upon how it could be used to solve some practical problems involving energy consumption today (see here ). In addition there are three additional paragraphs that provide further context surrounding the events mentioned above which should help readers understand what happened with researchers attempting their experiment during one particular week when both Tesla Motors and IBM have been making waves around world due primarily because they use similar technologies based purely off research conducted within its labs.\n\nThat's it for now! Keep your eyes peeled on the development blog to stay up with what we're working towards today and over our next 5 weeks of progress as well which will include:.\n\n(See also: How Google Is Preparing to Solve Big Problems with Its AI).\n\n---\n*Daily News | June 27, 2025*",
