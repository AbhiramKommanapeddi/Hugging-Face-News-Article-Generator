  "content": "ðŸ“° **Cybersecurity Firm Prevents Major International Data Breach**\n\nðŸ“‹ **Quick Summary**\n\n\n**Read time:** 1 minutes\n\n---\n\nOf this story on Friday. *In-depth analysis by our investigators shows that data breached at several major banks and large retailers was stored using stolen credit information obtained through an elaborate web of deception, frauds to gain access as well being sophisticated techniques used by cybercriminals who exploited vulnerabilities like passwords embedded into e-mail messages or files transferred via USB flash drives.*The identity theft ring targeted individuals seeking financial assistance with moving money from overseas accounts abroad without permission while retaining any funds within their own bank account (bank cards). The malware could be activated over multiple days when customers failed three checks before attempting transfer payments - one month prior to disclosure it would have required two additional times ($50 each) which is $100K per piece if all transactions were not.\n\n\n\nThe word \"cyber\" is used four times in this piece, but only once as an adjective: Cyber Security firm prevents major data breach . This phrase describes how cyber security firms are helping victims of international internet breaches to recover information and defend their systems against attacks from outside entities (i) by having employees implement advanced techniques so they can detect these intrusions before it occurs (ii); or else (iii), such hackers will not be able have access at all; or should do if possible due.\n\n---\n*Daily News | June 27, 2025*",
