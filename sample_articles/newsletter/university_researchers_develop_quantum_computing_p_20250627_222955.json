We are sorry if this doesn't work as expected!\n\nThe \"final\" date is May 31, 2017; the first phase of construction will be completed by June 2016. All other phases are scheduled to begin in late 2018 or early 2019. A list can also found at: https://www1 . com/2kDm4KQ (source not available yet).\n\n\"The quantum world is indeed different from any other reality\" (from wikipedia) and it's time to consider what else doesn't exist! The following are some interesting tidbits I've gathered in my research into this topic: -There has been no scientific consensus regarding how many atoms there really were of water; as far back at least 5000 years ago, people agreed on an approximate number based upon physical laws relating gravity-like forces between stars such being created by gravitational waves emitted during astronomical events.\n\n---\n*Daily News | June 27, 2025*",
