The event was described to me on Twitter and from my friends at @Jaeger_Articles (http://twitter, twitter.) The article states that \"this is real\" because they have been working with IBM Watson technology since 2014 which has helped them achieve breakthroughs like seeing patients earlier instead being sent home sick after reading their medical records over-the phone or getting stuck waiting eight hours just to find out what type blood test failed...and many more examples where this happens today! This means there are now 3rd party companies providing diagnostics based upon scientific research into how human bodies interact through genetic engineering--so I don't see why you cannot get your own company.\n\n\"The Trump administration is set to announce it will roll back the Obama Administration's net neutrality rules,\" reports Eric Lichtblau at Vox.com. He suggests that President Trump and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai are pushing for an end of these regulations because they don't fit with his vision as president:.\n\n\"The medical world has been awash with reports of breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence from this year's World Health Organization conference at Geneva, Switzerland. But what is truly revolutionary so far are advances in biometrics — sensors embedded into our bodies to detect diseases like HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis.\" The author goes on:.",
