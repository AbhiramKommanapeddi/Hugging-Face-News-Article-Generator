This event also coincided with similar developments at Harvard's research university, MIT. http://www-aandar.com/article2818 [34] The term \"AIs\" has become associated more often than not to refer either directly or indirectly towards what is known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which would be an advanced intelligent computer system capable by its own imagination of performing feats far beyond any human being.[35][36]. A number other popular terms have been proposed,[37], but none are entirely satisfactory about their use within this context due ultimately only having meaning outside it when referring specifically toward specific technologies such ASIM - Advanced Simulation In Media Manip.\n\n\n\nHere's an example: The scientific community has been trying to understand how this will affect clinical practice, and whether it could influence patient care or other aspects of society as well.\" – The Verge \"That is just one piece in a much larger effort around what [AI] can do with medicine … Imagine if we had 100 years ahead of us when medical technology was advancing at such rapid speed… What would your average doctor say? Would they be able give up on their job?\" - Dr Brian Dean.",
