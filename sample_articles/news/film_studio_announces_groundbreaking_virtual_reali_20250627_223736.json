It's not yet known if this event will have any effect at all or whether virtual reality is still just an experimental technology, but its existence could help spark interest again among developers looking into adding immersive experiences to their projects. HTC today unveiled three new devices based around gaming-specific hardware like SteamVR that offer full 360 degrees of freedom (similarly, Google Cardboard has already become popular). This year marks Valve Day with upcoming games titles such as Portal two; though it might be too soon now after having launched more than eight months ago - maybe even earlier!\n\nThe entire process will be completed in two phases: the first phase is where everything would happen (preventing and fighting crime); then it's what happens after that â€“ as soon at all possible when you know there are enough police officers on hand; while we wait for those details from DA Kenney he'll have time alone with his kids before meeting up again!\n\nIn summary, this technology could potentially have many more uses than just creating virtual reality content and is likely to become increasingly widespread in our lives as we all move into an ever-more immersive digital world.\" - John Ziegler (TechCrunch).",
